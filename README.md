# Vistara2024
A lucky draw website made for my college event VISTARA-2024 which has automated scripts to handle the data through excel sheets

## How to run this<br>
1. Run python app.py initially and go to the hosted web<br>
2. Run python app2.py in another terminal<br>
3. Enter the data one by one and wait until you obtain a lucky draw winner<br>
4. then go to the hosted web from the app2.py<br>
5. You can see the winner <br>

## What scripts are included<br>
* Data from the form directly steps into the student_details.xlsx <br>
* From there a random id will be picked and made as winner which is stored in LuckyWinner.xlsx<br>
* Finally the round{X} participants data will be stored in round{X}.xlsx and student_details.xlsx will be cleared for next round<br>
* The winners can be seen in winners.html by refresing the page<br>
