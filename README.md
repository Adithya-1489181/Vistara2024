# Vistara2024
A lucky draw website made for my college event VISTARA-2024 which has automated scripts to handle the data through excel sheets

#How to run this
Run python app.py initially and go to the hosted web
Run python app2.py in another terminal
Enter the data one by one and wait until you obtain a lucky draw winner
then go to the hosted web from the app2.py
You can see the winner 

#What scripts are included
Data from the form directly steps into the student_details.xlsx 
From there a random id will be picked and made as winner which is stored in LuckyWinner.xlsx
Finally the round{X} participants data will be stored in round{X}.xlsx and student_details.xlsx will be cleared for next round
The winners can be seen in winners.html by refresing the page
